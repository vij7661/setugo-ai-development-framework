# EXP-M — Review Evidence Delivery & Reviewer Context Integrity Falsification

## Status

`PREREGISTERED_BEFORE_EXECUTION`

## Motivation

The governed platform already distinguishes platform API review from pasted external evidence and binds review requests, reviewer identity, corpus hashes, semantic dimensions, and portable packet integrity.

EXP-M targets the next exposed trust boundary:

**authoritative evidence existing in the platform does not prove that the selected reviewer actually received the complete required evidence context.**

The failure mode is especially important for multi-model API review. Different providers may differ in:

- context capacity;
- file/attachment support;
- file size/count limits;
- format parsing;
- request truncation behavior;
- staged-message semantics;
- attachment visibility to the model.

A model may return `INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE` because evidence is truly absent, or because the platform failed to deliver it. Conversely, a model may return `PASS` after receiving only a subset of the required evidence.

EXP-M falsifies whether the platform can distinguish and fail closed on these states.

## Relationship to EXP-L

EXP-L governs independent review evidence/prompt integrity, materialization, citation grounding, prompt-injection boundaries, and frozen review execution.

EXP-M is complementary and narrower:

- EXP-L asks whether the review corpus and prompt are governed correctly.
- EXP-M asks whether that frozen corpus is actually delivered completely into the reviewer context and whether the verdict is admissible only after completeness is proven.

EXP-M does not supersede EXP-L.

## Core hypothesis

A material reviewer disposition cannot become admissible unless the platform proves that every mandatory evidence item in the frozen delivery manifest was delivered in an approved representation and the reviewer context was complete before adjudication.

## Invariants

### M-I01 — Scientific existence and delivery are separate facts

The platform must preserve independent states for:

- authoritative evidence existence;
- evidence materialization;
- evidence delivery;
- reviewer accessibility/context completeness.

### M-I02 — Delivery failure cannot masquerade as scientific insufficiency

If required evidence exists but the reviewer did not receive it, the outcome must not be classified solely as scientific `INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE`.

### M-I03 — Scientific absence cannot masquerade as delivery failure

If evidence genuinely does not exist, the platform must not blame transport/provider limits.

### M-I04 — Required evidence set is manifest-bound before dispatch

Every mandatory artifact and chunk is identified, hashed, sized, ordered, and bound to the exact ReviewRequest before provider invocation.

### M-I05 — Provider capability is explicit

The platform must not assume support for file types, attachment visibility, corpus size, or context capacity.

### M-I06 — No silent evidence omission

If required evidence cannot fit or cannot be consumed, dispatch must fail closed or use a separately qualified chunk protocol.

### M-I07 — Chunk completeness

Missing, duplicated, reordered, cross-request, corrupted, or stale chunks cannot establish context completeness.

### M-I08 — Reviewer receipt is non-dispositive

A completeness/receipt phase cannot itself create a review disposition.

### M-I09 — Review cannot begin before delivery completion

The platform must reject a disposition produced before required evidence delivery is complete.

### M-I10 — HTTP/API transport success is not delivery proof

HTTP 2xx, upload success, or API acceptance cannot independently establish model-visible evidence completeness.

### M-I11 — Required raw evidence cannot be replaced by unauthorized summaries

A compacted/summarized representation is only acceptable when the review contract explicitly permits that representation and it is integrity-bound.

### M-I12 — Provider-specific evidence profiles are preserved

When reviewers receive different representations, the difference must be explicit and dispositions must not be treated as directly equivalent without qualification.

### M-I13 — Verdict admissibility depends on delivery completeness

A semantic `PASS` is non-promotable if delivery completeness is not proven.

### M-I14 — Incomplete-context negative verdict remains diagnostic

A reviewer `CHANGES_REQUIRED` or `INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE` based on incomplete delivery is useful diagnostic evidence but cannot be misrepresented as a complete scientific adjudication.

### M-I15 — Failed delivery history is immutable

Retries do not erase or rewrite failed delivery attempts.

## Required mechanism surfaces

Future implementation should expose governed objects equivalent to:

- `EvidenceDeliveryManifest`
- `ProviderCapabilityProfile`
- `DeliveryPreflightResult`
- `EvidenceChunk`
- `ReviewerReceipt`
- `DeliveryCompletenessResult`
- `InsufficientEvidenceAdjudication`
- `VerdictAdmissibilityResult`

Names are not authoritative; semantics are.

## Frozen test families

### M-01 — Missing required final chunk

Deliver N-1 of N required chunks.

Expected:
- completeness false;
- review adjudication blocked;
- no promotable verdict.

### M-02 — Missing middle chunk

Drop a non-final chunk while preserving total metadata.

Expected:
- exact missing chunk detected;
- no silent reconstruction/pass.

### M-03 — Duplicate chunk

Deliver one chunk twice and omit another.

Expected:
- duplicate and missing identities both detected.

### M-04 — Reordered chunks

Deliver all chunks out of order.

Expected:
- either deterministic canonical reconstruction with verified IDs/hashes or fail closed;
- no semantic concatenation based on arrival order.

### M-05 — Modified chunk bytes

Alter one byte after manifest freeze.

Expected:
`EVIDENCE_CHUNK_HASH_MISMATCH`.

### M-06 — Wrong-request chunk replay

Replay a valid chunk from a previous ReviewRequest.

Expected:
request/corpus binding rejection.

### M-07 — Stale-reviewer receipt replay

Replay completeness acknowledgement from an earlier corpus.

Expected:
receipt request/corpus mismatch.

### M-08 — Provider unsupported ZIP/TAR

Manifest requires archive evidence but provider mode cannot expose archive contents.

Expected:
`EVIDENCE_FORMAT_UNSUPPORTED`;
no review authority.

### M-09 — Accepted upload but model cannot access attachment

Transport reports upload success; reviewer context cannot enumerate/use attachment.

Expected:
`EVIDENCE_ATTACHMENT_UNAVAILABLE`;
HTTP success does not upgrade completeness.

### M-10 — Context limit truncates trailing evidence

Construct corpus where decisive evidence is in the tail beyond qualified context.

Expected:
preflight blocks dispatch or completeness fails;
no silent reviewer verdict admission.

### M-11 — Context limit truncates middle evidence

Use provider/test adapter that drops an internal segment.

Expected:
item/chunk coverage mismatch.

### M-12 — Evidence count mismatch

Manifest requires 40 items; delivered corpus has 39.

Expected:
completeness false.

### M-13 — Manifest count copied without materialization

Outgoing envelope claims correct count but actual delivered item set is incomplete.

Expected:
independent reconstruction rejects.

### M-14 — Whole-corpus hash only false green

Whole outgoing payload hash exists but per-item required evidence mapping is missing.

Expected:
delivery completeness remains unproven.

### M-15 — Reviewer claims complete without proof

Reviewer returns `received_all_evidence=true` but platform delivery record is incomplete.

Expected:
reviewer self-attestation cannot establish completeness.

### M-16 — Reviewer adjudicates before receipt phase

Provider returns PASS immediately before completeness protocol completes.

Expected:
verdict inadmissible.

### M-17 — Genuine scientific evidence missing

Required artifact is absent from authoritative store before delivery.

Expected:
`SCIENTIFIC_EVIDENCE_MISSING`;
must not be called delivery failure.

### M-18 — Evidence exists, delivery omitted it

Artifact exists and is manifest-bound but is dropped before provider context.

Expected:
`EVIDENCE_DELIVERY_INCOMPLETE`;
must not be scientific insufficiency.

### M-19 — Provider format divergence

Same authoritative evidence sent to Reviewer A as raw Markdown and Reviewer B through unsupported archive/attachment mode.

Expected:
delivery profiles differ;
results not treated as equivalent consensus until both deliveries qualify.

### M-20 — One reviewer complete, one incomplete

Multi-review pipeline: one reviewer receives complete corpus; another misses mandatory evidence.

Expected:
only complete review may be considered under review semantics;
incomplete review is diagnostic/non-promotable.

### M-21 — Summary substituted for required raw artifact

Replace a mandatory raw log with proposer-generated summary.

Expected:
representation-class mismatch unless contract explicitly allows summary.

### M-22 — Chunk retry mutation

Retry a chunk with same index but different bytes/hash.

Expected:
binding mismatch; immutable failed attempt preserved.

### M-23 — Provider retry uses different corpus

Same ReviewRequest retry changes chunking/order/content.

Expected:
reject unless new delivery manifest/review execution boundary is created.

### M-24 — Missing evidence masked by long prompt

Required evidence is absent but prompt describes its supposed contents.

Expected:
prompt assertion cannot satisfy evidence presence.

### M-25 — Citation to inaccessible evidence

Reviewer cites evidence item that was manifest-listed but not delivered.

Expected:
coverage cannot be `TESTED_SUPPORTED`.

### M-26 — Partial file parsing

Provider exposes only first pages/portion of a required artifact.

Expected:
byte/range coverage recorded; full-required artifact remains incomplete.

### M-27 — Binary/encoding corruption

UTF-8/raw artifact transformed during delivery.

Expected:
hash/representation mismatch.

### M-28 — Evidence delivery timeout

Chunk delivery stalls before completion.

Expected:
non-authoritative delivery failure, preserved for retry.

### M-29 — Cross-provider context-capability mismatch

Corpus fits one provider but exceeds another.

Expected:
provider-specific preflight outcomes; no universal "review-ready" claim.

### M-30 — Negative verdict cause adjudication

Reviewer returns `INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE`.

Expected:
platform deterministically attributes missing requirement to:
scientific source, delivery/context, format capability, or unresolved cause.

## Required mutation/falsification cases

Mutation suite must attempt to make a verdict admissible by:

- forcing `context_complete=true`;
- forcing `received_all=true`;
- deleting a mandatory manifest item;
- altering required/optional flags;
- lowering expected chunk count;
- ignoring hash mismatch;
- trusting HTTP 200;
- trusting provider upload ID;
- accepting reviewer self-acknowledgement;
- converting delivery insufficiency into scientific insufficiency;
- converting scientific insufficiency into delivery failure;
- marking unsupported file as delivered;
- reusing old receipt;
- reusing old chunk;
- rebinding corpus hash;
- ignoring provider capability profile;
- treating different reviewer corpora as consensus;
- admitting PASS before receipt completion.

Every load-bearing mutation must be rejected.

## Required provider test adapters

The experiment should use deterministic fake/provider adapters before live-provider testing:

- `CompleteProviderAdapter`
- `DropFinalChunkAdapter`
- `DropMiddleChunkAdapter`
- `DuplicateChunkAdapter`
- `ReorderChunkAdapter`
- `CorruptChunkAdapter`
- `AttachmentInvisibleAdapter`
- `ContextTailTruncationAdapter`
- `PartialFileAdapter`
- `EarlyVerdictAdapter`
- `UnsupportedFormatAdapter`

Live API pilots come only after deterministic adapters prove the governor behavior.

## Live provider pilots

For each configured real provider/model/API mode, preregister a capability pilot that measures rather than assumes:

- maximum safe review corpus size;
- usable attachment formats;
- attachment count/size limits;
- whether uploaded files are actually model-visible;
- one-shot vs staged review support;
- response behavior near context limit;
- deterministic or detectable truncation behavior.

Provider limits are observations bound to provider/model/API version; they are not universal constants.

## Acceptance rule

EXP-M can reach bounded pass only when:

1. every mandatory frozen test passes;
2. no mutation can make an incomplete delivery verdict promotable;
3. scientific vs delivery insufficiency is deterministically separated;
4. provider capability uncertainty fails closed;
5. multi-reviewer comparison preserves reviewer-specific delivery identity;
6. failed delivery history is preserved;
7. no review authority is minted from completeness self-attestation.

A one-provider success cannot prove cross-provider delivery integrity.

## Nonclaims

EXP-M does not prove:

- the model semantically attended to every delivered token;
- arbitrary provider internals;
- cryptographic proof of remote model memory;
- universal provider limits;
- scientific correctness of the evidence itself.

It governs what the platform can prove about materialization, delivery, context completeness, and verdict admissibility.

## Governance effect

Until EXP-M is qualified for a review path, evidence-delivery completeness for large/multipart/file-based API reviews is a governed open boundary.

This preregistration authorizes no promotion and changes no existing authority state.
